# DAD-SGM
(Revision under IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence)  
We introduce a new research direction for distilling task-agnostic knowledge from self-supervised GNNs to MLPs.  
To achieve this, we design a GNN-to-MLP distillation that employs a diffusion teacher-assistant model.  
This approach drastically enhances the noise robustness of MLPa against input noise, thereby producing robust node representations with MLPs.  

# Setup
